While learning for the [AZ-900 Microsoft Azure Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-900) exam, I thought it would be nice to track my progress by taking notes on various topics that I need to learn for the exam. My approach? Start from [exam skill outline](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE3VwUY), follow the [learning paths](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-900?tab=tab-learning-paths) and links suggested by Thomas Maurer in his [AZ-900 Study Guide](https://www.thomasmaurer.ch/2020/03/az-900-study-guide-microsoft-azure-fundamentals-2020).

## Describe Cloud Concepts (15-20%)

### Describe the benefits and considerations of using cloud services

- **_describe terms such as High Availability, Scalability, Elasticity, Agility, Fault Tolerance, and Disaster Recovery_**

	- **High availability** - _Never go down_ or the ability to keep services up and running for long periods of time, with very little downtime.
	- **Scalability** - _Grow baby, grow_ or the ability to increase or decrease resources for any given workload (**out** and **up**). 
	- **Elasticity** - _Free to grow_ or the ability to automatically or dynamically increase or decrease resources as needed.
	- **Agility** - _Are you quick enough?_ or the ability to react quickly. Cloud services can allocate and deallocate resources quickly.
	- **Fault Tolerance** - _Wounded? I won't die!_ or the ability to remain up and running even in the event of a component (or service) no longer functioning (typically via redundancy)
	- **Disaster Recovery** - _Shit will never hit the fan_ or the ability to recover from an event which has taken down a cloud service.

- **_describe the principles of economies of scale_**

	The concept of economies of scale is the ability to reduce costs and gain efficiency when operating at a larger scale in comparison to operating at a smaller scale.

- **_describe the differences between Capital Expenditure (CapEx) and Operational Expenditure (OpEx)_**

	There are two approaches to investment:
		
	- **Capital Expenditure (CapEx):** This is the up front spending of money on physical infrastructure, and then deducting that up front expense over time.
	- **Operational Expenditure (OpEx):** This is spending money on services or products now and being billed for them now. You can deduct this expense in the same year you spend it.

- **_describe the consumption-based model_**

	Cloud service providers operate on a consumption-based model, which means that end users only pay for the resources that they use.

### Describe the differences between Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)

- **_describe Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)_**


- **_describe Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)_**


- **_describe Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)_**


- **_compare and contrast the three different service types_**


### Describe the differences between Public, Private and Hybrid cloud models

- **_describe Public cloud_**


- **_describe Private cloud_**


- **_describe Hybrid cloud_**


- **_compare and contrast the three different cloud models_**
