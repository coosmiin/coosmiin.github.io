While learning for the [AZ-900 Microsoft Azure Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-900) exam, I thought it would be nice to track my progress by taking notes on various topics that I need to learn for the exam. My approach? Start from [exam skill outline](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE3VwUY), follow the [learning paths](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-900?tab=tab-learning-paths) and links suggested by Thomas Maurer in his [AZ-900 Study Guide](https://www.thomasmaurer.ch/2020/03/az-900-study-guide-microsoft-azure-fundamentals-2020).
