While reading books or blogs about programing it happens that I encounter such cool explanations or metaphors about a specific topics that I imagine stopping the time and memorizing them on the spot. Since that is not possible, noting them down in a blog post seems like a decent idea.

## Design Patterns

#### Decorator vs Strategy

While comparing `Decorator` and `Strategy` patterns the [GoF](http://wiki.c2.com/?GangOfFour) guys make the a note that the difference between them is like *changing the skin of an object versus changing its guts*:
> We can think of a decorator as a skin over an object that changes its behavior. An alternative is to change the object's guts. The Strategy pattern is a good example of a pattern changing the guts.
